## Lab 2

# Part 1: Debugging
* Use the debugger in pycharm to debug [lab2.py](lab2.py)

# Part 2: Type Hinting
* Run mypy to type check
* Fix the issue with type checking (some of these might
  not be issues with the types being used, but lack of type
  checking in all places)
* Play around with what happens when it is called with something
  that doesn't match
