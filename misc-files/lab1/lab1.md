# Lab 1

The point of this lab is
1. to make sure everyone has their programming environment setup
2. to give everyone a chance to practice programming

## Part 1: Environment Setup
If you plan to use the EOS labs, you are good to go.

If you wish to use your laptop, that is also fine.
The most common IDE for Python is [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
If you didn't use this in 162, then you will want to
[download](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) and install it.

If you aren't a fan of PyCharm, you are free to use another IDE (VSCode is also common).

## Part 2:  Programming Practice
Once you have your environment setup,
go complete [lab1](https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/141391/assessment/2362289)
on PrairieLearn.
